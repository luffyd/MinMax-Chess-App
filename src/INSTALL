To build the applet, unpack the .jar file (You've presumably done that
if you're reading this message) and do

1) javac *.java
2) jar cf ChessApp.jar *.class images

ChessApp.jar now contains everything the applet needs.

See the ChessApp webpage
http://english.op.org/~peter/ChessApp/index.html for the kind of
<APPLET> tag you need to include this on a webpage.
